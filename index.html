    <h1>The Valentine Vault</h1>

    <br><br>

    Some things are best appreciated for a short time, before their beauty fades away.
    But some stuff is fun indefinitely. Hopefully, these Valentine's Day entertainments
    fall into the latter category.

    <br><br>

    ;-)

    <h2>2015: <a href="2015/TheGreatEscape/public/index.html">The Great Escape</a></h2>
    <br>

    You play this game as the evil villain attempting to stop Alex from escaping your clutches to do some fun thing. Catch him so you can make him go do something responsible and appropriate!

    <br><br>

    <h2>2014: <a href="2014/FlappyAlex/public/index.html">Flappy Alex</a></h2>
    <br>

    Inspired by the epic saga of Alex learning to walk. You will need to be able to tap, to play this. Try a tablet.

    <br><br>

    <h2>2013: <a href="2013/board.html">Jigsaw Alex</a></h2>
    <br>
    A remix of the classic jigsaw format, now with a perhaps more fascinating subject.
    Because baby pictures are always fun.

    <br><br>

    <h2>2012: <a href="2012/index.html">Wordsquare</a></h2>
    <br>
    Make words, make messages. Designed to be played on a Galaxy Nexus. You might
    need a touchscreen device to have this work at all.

    <br><br>

    <h2>2011: <a href="2011/valentine2011.gif">Hide And Seek</a></h2>
    <br>
    A tale of love, despair, and triumph.
    
    <br><br>

    <h2>2010: <a href="2010/blocks/Blocks.swf">Anna Blocks</a></h2>
    <br>
    Make the word ANNA. A whole lot of Annas!

    <br><br>

    <h2>2009: <a href="2009/annaken.html">Annaken</a></h2>
    <br>
    Like Kenken, but Anna-themed.

    <br><br>

    <h2>2008: <a href="2008/2008.html">Cryptograms</a></h2>
    <br>
    What does each letter stand for? Something awesome.

    <br><br>

    <h2>2007: <a href="2007/board.html">Jigsaw Anna</a></h2>
    <br>
    Fun with some early Anna & Kevin pictures.

    <br><br>

    <h2>2006: <a href="2006/small_annamaytion.gif">The Pursuit Of Justice</a></h2>
    <br>
    A little snapshot of how it felt, a year in.
